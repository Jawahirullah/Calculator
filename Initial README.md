# Calculator
creating logic for calculator

this class is upgraded.so that it can take expression which has

1.minus sign at the start of the expression
2.minus sign after the opening bracket
3.open bracket immediately after closing bracket without mentioning any symbol in between them
4.placing number after opening or closing bracket

but,its limitation is 

it is a class with all the methods and variables are static.
so,we can use it only once

we have to make it variables and methods non-static to call the calculator multiple times.
